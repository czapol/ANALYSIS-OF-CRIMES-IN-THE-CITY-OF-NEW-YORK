DATA MODELING (SUPERVISED LEARNING)	- Linear regression model for relationship between severe crime rates and different demographic indicators
DATA MODELING (UNSUPERVISED LEARNING) - study of clustering in the dataset involving: 
	SIMILARITIES BETWEEN BOROUGHS - cosine similarities between boroughs
	PRECINCT SEGMENTATION - methods to investigate clustering among precincts using:
		T-DISTRIBUTED STOCHASTIC NEIGHBOR EMBEDDING	
		PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS	
		CLUSTERING METHODS	
	SIMILARITIES BETWEEN PRECINCTS (TOOL) a tool to find out the top most similar precinct and the most contributing crimes 
ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS	- limitations of the analysis
RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK	- recommendation for the next steps
CONCLUSIONS - summary of the analysis
